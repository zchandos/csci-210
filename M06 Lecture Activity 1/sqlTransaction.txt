In my business an example of a transaction would be if a customer would purchase an item from the merchants inventory.
The sql statement for this would be as follows:

DELETE FROM item
WHERE itemID = 6;

This is going to remove the item from the item table that has the itemID of 6. This is because the customer purchased it.
